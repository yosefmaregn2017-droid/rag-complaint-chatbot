    "In this notebook, you will learn:\n",
    "1. **Why evaluate RAG systems** - understanding failure modes\n",
    "2. **Create evaluation questions** covering different aspects\n",
    "3. **Run systematic evaluation** and collect results\n",
    "4. **Score responses manually** using a clear rubric\n",
    "5. **Generate evaluation reports** in markdown format\n",
    "6. **Debug and tune** retrieval parameters (k, chunk size)\n",

    "## Why Evaluate RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG systems can fail in many ways:\n",
    "- **Retrieval failures**: Wrong documents retrieved\n",
    "- **Context ignored**: LLM doesn't use the provided context\n",
    "- **Hallucination**: LLM makes up information not in context\n",
    "- **Incomplete answers**: Important details missing\n",
    "\n",
    "Systematic evaluation helps identify and fix these issues.\n",

    "|-----------|----------------|\n",
